Emotion Dectection Application

Motivation: We are constantly displaying expressions as a response to some external stimuli

Objective:
  - Design a system to capture and process human emotions as a time series data to ultimately improve one's experience.
  - To provide user statistics over time on a given platform such as gaming machines, online education, etc.

# Abstract
The Emotion Detection Device (E.D.D.) aims to demonstrate possible emotion recognition applications in the following domains: gaming, education, and market research. This project employs Real-Time Intelligent Systems (RTIS); intelligent, real-time systems that can observe the world, learn from these observations, understand the environment and are designed to operate continuously and robustly through all operating modes. Technologies used by E.D.D. to develop “real” solutions include: computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition. The project integrates emotion recognition as input to existing technologies such as gaming machines, online education platforms, and/or market research to improve the facilitation of acquiring business goals and objectives. The physical components consist of: a camera to capture video or images; a small computer for image processing and classifying emotions; and a microcontroller programmed to deliver the output of our system as emotional data. This emotional data can be used to make inferences about the consumer and gain insightful information on existing or emerging products and/or services. Utilizing this product will improve pedagogical practices in online education platforms, reduce costs of market research for businesses, and enhance product key performance indicators (KPIs) overall. E.D.D. is self-contained but can easily be scalable and integrated into ongoing devices of enterprise-level businesses.
